# GESI: Developed Python code for single imputation of missing data using generalized regression neural network for an unlabeled numerical and categorical data set.
The incomplete data set is divided into complete and incomplete data set and SAGA
algorithm is applied to choose the optimal data set. The divided subsets are used to train the
GRNN, and the model is fed to impute the missing data. Also calculate the Normalized
Root Mean Square value for the numerical data sets by comparing the imputed data sets with
the original data sets.
